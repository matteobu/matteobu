## Hello, I’m Matteo! 

I'm a Software Engineer whiz with a solid decade in the project management game.
These days I’m messin’ around with Python too, tryin’ to make friends with the snake 🐍.

- 🧑🏻‍💻 JavaScript and Typescript are my jam, currently leveling up with Python.
- 🚐 Whenever possible, I grab my van and cruise around Berlin.
- 🏃🏻‍♂️ I hit the pavement and clock those km. 2x⭐️⭐️ times Berlin Marathon finisher.
- ❓ Slide into my DMs if you're on the hunt for the town's top pizza spots 🍕.
- 📚 Crime books got me hooked! Total page-turner vibes, you know? 🕵️‍♂️.
